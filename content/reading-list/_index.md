The chess atlas reading list is a collection of books, videos, podcasts, and
other media I'm using while learning chess.

As of now, it's just a [notion.so](https://notion.so) table that you can browse
[here](https://www.notion.so/Chess-Atlas-Reading-list-4534826d95f54481b3e8b4cd93dbf64d). As I proceed with reviews of
the content, I'll rework the section and enrich it with the media I find most useful.
