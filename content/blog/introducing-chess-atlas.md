As this is the first blog posy, an explanation of what the chess atlas is about
is in order. I'll go over what my motivations are (aka why am I  doing this?),
what I intend to write about (aka what's a chess atlas anyway?), and the way I
planned to procede (aka how am I going about this?).

# Why

There are two reasons why I'm sharing my experience of trying to get better at
chess as an adult. The first reason is unrelated to chess: I love writing. I
used to write about my job, but I don't care as much about it as I used to do.
Which is a perfect segue for the second reason. 


At the time of writing, I'm a 37 years old and recently became a father. You can
imagine, it's always busy. While I found information (I intend to provide a
comphresensive reading list as I progress with my studies) about adults wanting
to get better at Chess, so far I couldn't find anything that can engage me long
term. **Learning this game is overwhelming**, and most adults don't have enough
time to get to their full potential. Writing is my way of making sure I make the
most out of styding the game. I retain information better if I write it down. So
why not sharing it anyway?

# What

I need to define what getting better at chess means. At least, I need my own
definition so I can draft an initial plan. I want to underline initial as I
don't believe in long term planning. I believe in taking into account the things
you learn on the way, some of those will probably lead to a change of plans. But
even making an initial plan seems hard,  **Chess is too vast and I don't want to
get lost**. So, maybe, the word I'm looking for is map. Following this metaphore
to its full extend was the spark that lead to this website. Think of Chess as
uncharted territory. After you learn the rules of the game, you're left with an
almost empty map. At sight though you can see the phases of the game:

- Opening
- Middle-game
- Endgame

The idea is to draw a map as I go on this trip. I'll be providing details while
exploring one of those three places. And I'll surely need to add places I can't
even see at sight now that I'm starting the jurney.


I'm going to admit it: I absolutely love metapthor. Here's
[wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlas) definition for Atlas:

> An atlas is a collection of maps; it is typically a bundle of maps of Earth or
> a region of Earth. 

Now exchange Earth with Chess and you get my idea. Chess is an immense topic so
*one* map is not going to cut it. I will be creating a collection of maps. Each
place, again following the metaphore, will have its own section on this website.
That way exploring its content should be easier (I love feedback, please [reach
out](mailto://hello@chessatlas.net)!)

# How

I have three goals with this website:

- I want to write a lot
- I want to map as much Chess knowdlege as possible
- I want to share my experience as an adult with a busy life trying to get
  better at Chess

Now with those three in mind, the approach that I find more natural is to
build the map in the open (the atlas itself) and provide diary entries (the blog
part) as I go.

In the next blog post, I'll be explaing where I'm at in the journey at the
moment, what my current study plans are. 

As for the atlas itself, I will provide a list of lists in the [atlas
section](/content/atlas/_index.md) for now. The long term plan though is a
little more complex and it's an interesting project on its own. The metaphore is
strong so I could go as far as providing a google maps experience. I find the
idea stimulating but somehow too complex. One other idea is to provide an
interactive [mind map](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind_map) which would fit
the atlas well enough (mind maps have too much focus on hierachy though and I'm
unsure how relevant this would be here).


As you can see, everything on this website is a work in progress and I intend to
keep it that way.

Hope you enjoyed it and see you soon!
