As this is the first blog post on the chess atlas, an explanation of what this
website is about is in order. I'll go over what my motivations are (aka why am I
even doing this?), what I intend to write about (aka what's a chess atlas
anyway?), and the way I planned to procede (aka how am I going about this?).

# Why

There are two reasons why I'm sharing my experience of trying to learn chess as
an adult. The first reason is unrelated to chess: I love writing. I used to
write about work related topics, but I don't care as much about work as I used
to do. Which is a perfect segue for the second reason. 


At the time of writing, I'm a 37 years old, soon to be a father, married man.
You can imagine, it's always busy for me. I can't say there's a lot of
information on the internet for people at a similar stage of their life trying
to get better at chess. **Learning this game is overwhelming**. And that's a
perfect segue for the next paragraph.

# What

I need to define what getting better at chess means. At least, I need my own
definition so I can draft an initial plan. I want to underloine initial as I
don't believe in long term planning. I want to take into account the things you
learn on the way, some of those will probably lead to a change of plans. So,
maybe, the word I'm  looking for is map. **Chess is too vast and I don't want to
get lost**.

This idea gave birth to the chess atlas. Chess is mostly a uncharted word for me
and the metaphore works nicely.
