As this is the first blog post on the chess atlas, an explanation of what this
website is about is in order. I'll go over what my motivations are (aka why am I
even doing this?), what I intend to write about (aka what's a chess atlas
anyway?), and the way I planned to procede (aka how am I going about this?).

# Why

There are two reasons why I'm sharing my experience of trying to learn chess as
an adult. The first reason is unrelated to chess: I love writing. I used to
write about work related topics, but I don't care as much about writing about
work as I used to do. Which is a perfect segue for the second reason. 


At the time of writing, I'm a 37 years old, soon to be a father, married man.
You can imagine, it's always busy. While you can find information (I'll be
sharing my finding as we go) about adults wanting to get better at Chess, so far
I couldn't find anything that can engage me long term. **Learning this game is
overwhelming**, and most adults don't have enough time to get to their full
potential. So writing is my way of making sure I make the most out of styding
the game.

# What

I need to define what getting better at chess means. At least, I need my own
definition so I can draft an initial plan. I want to underline initial as I
don't believe in long term planning. I want to take into account the things you
learn on the way, some of those will probably lead to a change of plans. So,
maybe, the word I'm  looking for is map. **Chess is too vast and I don't want to
get lost**. Following this metaphore to its full extend was the spark for The
Chess Atlas. During this journey, I will think of Chess as uncharted territory.
After you learn the rules of the game, you're left with an almost empty map. At
sight you can see just a few things:

- Opening
- Middle-game
- Endgame

The idea is to draw a map as I go on this trip. I'll be providing details while
exploring one of those three places. And I'll surely need to add places you
can't even see at sight as you start the jurney.


I'm going to admit it: I absolutely love metapthor. Here's
[wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlas) definition for Atlas:

> An atlas is a collection of maps; it is typically a bundle of maps of Earth or
> a region of Earth. 

Now exchange Earth with Chess and you get my idea. Chess is an immense topic so
*one* map is not going to cut it. I will be creating a collection of maps. Each
place, so to speak, will have its own section on this website. That way
exploring its content should be easier (I love feedback! Please [reach
out](EMAIL) to me!)

# How

You could say I have three goals with this website:

- I want to write a lot
- I want to map as much Chess knowdlege as possible
- I want to share my experience as an adult with a busy life trying to get
  better at Chess

Now with those three in mind, the approach that seems more natural to me is to
build the map in the open (the atlas itself) and provide diary entries (the blog
part) as I go.

In the next blog post, I'll be explaing where I'm at in the journey at the
moment, what my current plans for studying are. And hopefully, I'll also be
providing a first sketch of the atlas.

Hope you enjoyed it and see you soon!
