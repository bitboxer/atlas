# Why

There are two reasons why I'm sharing my experience of trying to learn chess as
an adult. The first reason is unrelated to chess: I love writing. I used to
write a lot about work related topics, but I don't care as much about work as I
used to do. Which is a perfect segue for the second reason. At the time of
writing, I'm a 37 years old, soon to be a father, married man. You can imagine,
it's always busy for me. I can't say there's a lot of information on the
internet for people at a similar stage of their life trying to get better at
chess. Learning this game is overwhelming. And that's a perfect segue for the
next paragraph.

# What

I need to define what getting better at chess means. At least, I need my own
definition so I can draft an initial plan. I say initial as I don't believe in
long term planning. That approach wouldn't take into account the things you
learn on the way, some of those often lead to a change of plans. So, maybe, the
word I'm  looking for is map. Chess is too vast and I don't want to get lost.
