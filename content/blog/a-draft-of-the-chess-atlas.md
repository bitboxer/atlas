You can hear chess players saying they've got the chess bug. And if you're into chess, there's a high chance you think
you got the same bug. The passion for the game is hard to explain in words, there's too many aspects. The fascination of
its logical thinking, its strategic insights, not to mention the beauty of a [perfect
information](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfect_information) game.

When you start playing chess and get the hang of it, soon enough you start loosing matches and you have idea why. It can
become quite frustrating and some people lose interest. But what if you don't? What if you want to get better and find
your limits? Where do you start? 

In this blog post, I'm sharing how I'm approaching the study of the game as an adult with a busy life. At this point,
some contextual information about me as a chess player may be helpful. 


I grew up in a small town north of Napoli. One of my uncles, a club level chess player, taught me the game when I was
twelve or so and then brought me to some local tournaments. I remember loving the atmosphere of the tournaments, all
those chessboard lined up on long tables, the ticking of the clocks, the intensity of thoughts flowing around. I was
into it for a while and then I moved on to other things. I don't actually remember losing interest in the game. It just
happened like many things in my teens. Then, just a few months ago, I started thinking I needed some quite hobby. I was
about to get a kid and my usual stress relief is a little too loud (I play all kind of guitars, none of which can be
described as a quite hobby). I remembered enjoying chess and gave it a try again. The passion for the game hit me very
hard. I discovered a whole new world. Elite tournaments being streamed on youtube, great websites like
[lichess.org](https://lichess.org), and extremely enjoyable content like [agadmator's chess
Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCL5YbN5WLFD8dLIegT5QAbA). I started playing a lot, mostly blitz and rapid.
And, just a couple of months after this happened, I realized I actually knew nearly nothing about the game. I wanted to
know more, I needed to know more.

So, again, where do you start start? As I said, and will probably say many more times, chess is too vast, so vast in
fact it's very easy to get lost. So I did what I always do when I have to learn something difficult: I broke the problem
down. The first breakdown is obviously about stages. The game has an opening, a middle game, and endgame. Now the
question is can I study those three stages in parallel? The answer to me is of the worst kind: yes and no. Yes, because
of course all phases of the game are important. Equally important I'd say. No, because most experienced players would
tell you to start from the endgame. It felt very counterintuitive to me for quite a while. Then one morning I was
walking to the office and connected dots via a pretty unrelated route. I'm into cooking a lot, and [my favorite cooking
book](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30753841-salt-fat-acid-heat) (if you want to get better at cooking _anything_,
look no further) introduced me to a beautiful process. If you want to reach a specific goal with a dish, walk it
backward. Picture the final result and apply what you know about cooking to get there. I believe the concepts applies to
chess as well, actually to anything else. The endgame you play is a consequence of middle-game, and the middle-game you
play is a consequence of the opening you chose. So while it seems very logical to start studying the game from the
opening, it's probably not the best strategy. For this reason, I decided to ignore books or videos about opening (some
exceptions here. I'll get back to this later) and middle-game so that I can focus on the fundamentals of the endgame.

Now that I've established the main focus of my studies, it's time to get into the details. It's obviously a personal
decision, but I retain information best when:

- I read a book
- I write about what I read

Which will result in me publishing a review of the chess books I read. I have a specific format in mind for those
review. Reading is mostly a pleasure for me, so when I review a book I express my opinion in the form of "I like this, I
don't like that". The chess books  I'm reading are different as I have goals in mind when I read books. For that reason,
I'll always provide the context that lead me to read a book, and the review will be a description of how close to the
expectations I had for the specific book.

I hope I clarified a little where I'm at and how I intend to proceed. My intention is to enrich this website every time
I learn something new. As we're just getting started, the most natural first step is a draft of the [Atlas](/atlas). At
the time of writing, it looks like this:

There are a few things to say:

- This is more or less all I know to some degree. It's not much. But that's the point.
- Yes, it looks pretty ugly. I agree. But I know the Atlas will inevitably change as I study so what's the point of
  trying to make it look great now that I know so little about where this website will go?
- Middle-game and strategy are one section. I started with two sections only to realise I don't really understand the
  difference between the two. I feel there's not much difference, but my knowledge is very limited. Once again, I prefer
  to show things as they are right now instead of trying to come up with the perfect map.
- It's just a list of lists. There's no content yet and the idea is to provide it as I go while I study things. I will
  probably write a blog post for each section as they are now. And then expand each section from there.

  Hope you enjoyed it and see you soon!
